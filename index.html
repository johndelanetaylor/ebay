				<h2>Brand New 16GB White Apple iPhone 5 for Verizon</h2>	
       	<p>This listing is for a brand new iPhone 5. I received this phone as a replacement from Apple due to a mishap with a battery recall on my original device. There was a mix up with my phone not being fixed properly so they decided to replace it entirely.</p>
				<p>I am selling this iPhone 5 is beacuase I decided not to use it and instead upgraded to an iPhone 6.</p>
